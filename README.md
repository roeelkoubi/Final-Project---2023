This project is designed to calculate the matching between Objects and Pictures. It deals with a set of Pictures and Objects of different sizes. 
Each member of the matrix represents a "color," and the range of possible colors is [1, 100]. 
For each pair of overlapping members, the difference is calculated, and the total difference is defined as an average of all relative differences for all overlapping members. 
We will call it Matching (I, J).

Inputs: The input for the project is a set of Pictures and Objects of different sizes. 
As input, we got â€“ Matching value, number of pictures, picture id, picture dimension, and N line of members of the picture row by row. 
We got the same things for the objects.

Output: The output of the project is the Matching (I, J) for each Position (I, J) of the Object in the Picture.
This project finds if the given picture contains at least three objects from the given object set and writes the result to the output.txt file.
